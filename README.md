# RenPy_Maker
Ren'Py Maker allows you to create a visual novel for Ren'Py (renpy.org) within the Unity editor. You can add dialogs, pictures, music and sounds by adding nodes to a visual graph. Ren'Py Maker has all you need to make your own visual novel easily and quickly. Ren'Py Maker also supports menus, labels, and jumps to make a fully dynamic novel that allows for branching based on the reader's choices. You can even test and build your novel in Unity!

You can find more information and the online tutorials here at https://www.RenPyMaker.com


Ren'Py is a very complex scripting language and creating a full set of nodes and advanced features will take time. If you would like to get access to the full version of Ren'Py Maker as it is being made and also help support the development of the program then you can subscribe to my Patreon channel.

Ren'Py Maker has been released for free with full source code in gratitude to Thor Brigsted, the author of xNode, who released his fantastic node editor for free. And as a big thank you to a couple of great xNode tutorials released on YouTube, as well as to the authors of Unity itself. Each of which allowed me to make this software.
